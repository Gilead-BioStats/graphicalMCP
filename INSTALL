PLEASE USE R 3.0 OR A NEWER VERSION OF R, IF AVAILABLE.
IF YOU NEED gMCP FOR AN OLDER VERSION OF R, PLEASE CONTACT US!
(It is theoretically compatible with R 2.8.0 and rJava 0.6-3)

gMCP requires Java >= 5.0 - most likely it is already installed on 
your computer. If it is not, download and install it from: 
http://www.java.com/en/download/

If you do not have R already installed and use a 32 bit system, you can 
download it bundled with gMCP and all dependencies from:

 http://www.algorithm-forge.com/gMCP/bundle/
 Unzip it and double click on the R.exe in folder "bin" to
 bring up an R console with an automatically started gMCP GUI.
 
If you have an 64-bit Windows system, please start the RGUI 64-bit if
your Java Runtime Environment is also 64-bit. If the installed Java is
32-bit please run the 32-bit R.

General Troubleshooting:
========================

 * "Warning: unable to move temporary installation 'XYZ' to 'ZYX'"
If you get this warning while installing or updating packages,
most likely some other Windows program is accessing the newly installed 
files and prevents R to move them to the correct place.
Often simply trying to install the package a second time works.
Otherwise try to pause your antivirus programs or search indexing 
(like Google Desktop Search) while installing the packages.

 * If you run into a "MSVCR71.dll is missing" please try updating your
rJava installation (install.packages("rJava")) or add your JAVA_HOME
directory (something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\") to your
PATH.

 * If "rJava.dll" can not be loaded or the "jvm.dll" can not be found
try setting JAVA_HOME in R before loading rJava or gMCP:

Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME="C:/Program Files/Java/jre6/")

(Please check that this is the correct path on your system for your 
Java 6 installation and adapt it otherwise.)

 * "Error: cannot obtain Class.getSimpleName method ID" or
   "Error in .jinit() : unable to find the basic String class"
It looks like you have an ancient Java version installed (Java 1.4 is 
from 2002!) that is used.
Please check that Java >= 1.5 is installed and try to tell rJava to use 
this newer version of Java by setting JAVA_HOME accordingly as described 
in the previous paragraph.

 * rJava does not install on a UNIX system. 
Most likely you will have to run the command "R CMD javareconf" with
root permissions to let R find your java compiler and headers.

 * Try setInternet2(TRUE) if R can not connect to the internet.

 * I get: 

     Loading required package: rJava
     Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
       call: fun(libname, pkgname)
       error: JAVA_HOME cannot be determined from the Registry
     Error: package 'rJava' could not be loaded

   or

     Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
       call: fun(libname, pkgname)
       error: No CurrentVersion entry in Software/JavaSoft registry! 
       Try re-installing Java and make sure R and Java have matching architectures.
     Error: package ‘rJava’ could not be loaded

   Java is not installed or at least not in the correct variant.
   For example if you have only Java 32-bit on a 64-bit system
   and you start the 64-bit R you will run into this error.
