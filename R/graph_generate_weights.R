#' Generate the weighting strategy based on a graphical multiple comparison
#' procedure
#'
#' @description
#' A graphical multiple comparison procedure defines a closed test procedure,
#' which tests each intersection hypothesis and reject an individual hypothesis
#' if all intersection hypotheses involving it have been rejected. An
#' intersection hypothesis represents the parameter space where individual null
#' hypotheses involved are true simultaneously.
#'
#' The closure based on a graph consists of all updated graphs (corresponding
#' to intersection hypotheses) after all combinations of hypotheses are deleted.
#' For a graphical multiple comparison procedure with $m$ hypotheses, there are
#' $2^{m}-1$ updated graphs (intersection hypotheses), including the initial
#' graph (the overall intersection hypothesis). The weighting strategy of this
#' graph consists of hypothesis weights from all $2^{m}-1$ updated graphs
#' (intersection hypotheses). The algorithm to derive the weighting strategy is
#' based on Algorithm 1 in Bretz et al. (2011).

#' @return A numeric matrix of all intersection hypotheses and their hypothesis
#' weights. For a graphical multiple comparison procedure with $m$ hypotheses,
#' the number of rows is $2^{m}-1$, each of which corresponds to an intersection
#' hypothesis. The number of columns is \eqn{2\cdot m}$. The first $m$ columns
#' indicate which individual hypotheses are included in a given intersection
#' hypothesis and the second half of columns provide hypothesis weights for each
#' individual hypothesis for a given intersection hypothesis.
#'
#' @section Performance:
#' Generation of intersection hypotheses is closely related to the power set
#' of a given set of indices. As the number of hypotheses increases, the memory
#' and time usage can grow quickly (e.g., at a rate of $O(2^n)$). There are also
#' multiple ways to implement Algorithm 1 in Bretz et al. (2011). See
#' `vignette("generate-closure")` for more information about generating
#' intersection hypotheses and comparisons of different approaches to calculate
#' weighting strategies.
