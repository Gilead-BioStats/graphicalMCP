Description: Graphical multiple comparison procedures (MCPs) control
    the familywise error rate. This class includes many commonly used 
    procedures as special cases. This package is a low-dependency
    implementation of graphical MCPs which allow mixed types of tests.
    It also includes power simulations and visualization of graphical MCPs.
