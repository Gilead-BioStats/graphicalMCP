Description: A multiple comparison procedure (or multiple test procedure)
    is a a statistical analysis method for determining efficacy of
    multiple drugs, or multiple doses of the same drug, in a single
    clinical trial. Bretz, et al (2011) laid out a graph-based approach to
    these multiple comparison procedures, in which the weights of the
    vertices and edges of the graph are determined independently of the
    particular statistical test used to assess results. This package is a
    low-dependency implementation of the methods described in that paper.
