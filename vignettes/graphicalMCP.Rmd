# Introduction

Graphical approaches for multiple comparison procedures (MCPs) are a general framework to control the familywise error rate strongly as a pre-specified significance level $0<\alpha<1$. This approach includes many commonly used MCPs as special cases and is transparent in visualizing MCPs for better communications. `graphicalMCP` is designed to design and analyze graphical MCPs in a flexible, informative and efficient way.

# Basic usage

## Initial graph

The base object in `graphicalMCP` is an `initial_graph`, which consists of a vector of hypothesis weights and a matrix of transition weights [@bretz-2009-graphical]. This object can be created via `graph_create()`. In the graphical representation, hypotheses are denoted as nodes (or vertices) associated with hypothesis weights. A directed edge from a hypothesis to another indicates the direction of propagation of the hypothesis weight from the origin hypothesis to the end hypothesis. The edge is weighted by a transition weight indicating the proportion of propagation.

```{r create-graph, fig.dim=c(3, 3)}
library(graphicalMCP)
# A graph of two primary hypotheses (H1 and H2) and two secondary hypotheses (H3 and H4)
hypotheses <- c(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0)
transitions <- rbind(
  c(0, 0, 1, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 1),
  c(0, 1, 0, 0),
  c(1, 0, 0, 0)
)
hyp_names <- c("H1", "H2", "H3", "H4")
example_graph <- graph_create(hypotheses, transitions, hyp_names)
example_graph
```

```{r plot-graph, fig.dim=c(3, 3)}
plot(example_graph, vertex.size = 60)
```

## Update graph

When a hypothesis is removed from the graph, hypothesis and transition weights of remaining hypotheses should be updated according to Algorithm 1 in @bretz-2011-graphical. For example, assume that hypotheses H1, H2 and H4 are removed from the graph. The updated graph after removing three hypotheses is below.

```{r update-graph}
updated_example <- graph_update(
  example_graph,
  delete = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
)

updated_example
```

```{r plot-updated-graph, fig.dim=c(3, 3)}
plot(updated_example, vertex.size = 60)
```

# Perform graphical MCPs

Given the set of p-values of all hypotheses, graphical MCPs can be performed using `graph_test_shortcut()` to determine which hypotheses can be rejected at the significance level `alpha`. Assume p-values are 0.01, 0.005, 0.03, and 0.01 for hypotheses H1-H4. With a one-sided significance level `alpha = 0.025`, rejected hypotheses are H1, H2, and H4. More details about the shortcut testing can be found in `vignette("shortcut-testing")`.

```{r test-graph-shortcut}
test_results <- graph_test_shortcut(
  example_graph,
  p = c(.01, .005, .03, .01),
  alpha = .025
)
test_results$outputs$rejected
```

A similar testing procedure can be performed using the closure principle. This will allow more tests for intersection hypotheses, e.g., Simes, parametric and a mixture of them. If the test type is Bonferroni, the resulting closed procedure is equivalent to the shortcut procedure above. Additional details about closed testing can be found in `vignette("closed-testing")`.

```{r test-graph}
test_results_closed <- graph_test_closure(
  example_graph,
  p = c(.01, .005, .03, .01),
  alpha = .025,
  test_types = "bonferroni",
  test_groups = list(1:4)
)
test_results_closed$outputs$rejected
```

# Power simulations

With multiplicity adjustment, such as graphical MCPs, the "power" to reject each hypothesis will be affected, compared to its marginal power. The latter is the power to rejected a hypothesis at the significance level `alpha` without multiplicity adjustment. The marginal power is usually obtained from other pieces of statistical software. `graph_calculate_power()` performs power simulations to assess the power after adjusting for the graphical MCP [@bretz-2011-test]. Assume that the marginal power to reject H1-H4 is 90%, 90%, 80%, and 80% and all test statistics are independent of each other. The local power after the multiplicity adjustment is 87.7%, 87.7, 67.2%, and 67.2% respectively for H1-H4. Additional details about power simulations can be found in `vignette("shortcut-testing")` and `vignette("closed-testing")`.

```{r power}
set.seed(1234)
power_results <- graph_calculate_power(
  example_graph,
  sim_n = 1e6,
  power_marginal = c(.9, .9, .8, .8)
)
power_results$power$power_local
```
