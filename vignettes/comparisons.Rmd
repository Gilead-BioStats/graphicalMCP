# Introduction

There are two R packages that cover graphical multiple comparison procedures (MCPs): `gMCP` [@rohmeyer-2020-gmcp] and `lrstat` [@lu-2023-lrstat]. The development of `graphicalMCP` benefited from these two packages. Here we provide some comparisons between `graphicalMCP` and other packages with respect to key functions.

# List of comparisons

- Weighting strategy for the closure
  - `graphicalMCP::graph_generate_weights`
  - `gMCP::generateWeights`
- Sequentially rejective procedures based on Bonferroni tests
  - `graphical::graph_test_shortcut`
  - `gMCP::gMCP`
- Power simulation for sequentially rejective procedures
  - `graphicalMCP::graph_calculate_power`
  - `gMCP::calcPower`
- Closed procedures with parametric tests
  - `graphicalMCP::graph_test_closure`
  - `gMCP::gMCP`
- Power simulation for closed procedures with parametric tests
  - `graphicalMCP::graph_calculate_power`
  - `gMCP::calcPower`
- Closed procedures with Simes tests
  - `graphicalMCP::graph_test_closure`
  - `gMCP::gMCP`
- Power simulation for closed procedures with Simes tests
  - `graphicalMCP::graph_calculate_power`
  - `gMCP::calcPower`

# Comparisons of weighting strategies

A random graph for five hypotheses will be generated and used for the comparison. Weighting strategies from the following two functions will be compared: `graphicalMCP::graph_generate_weights` and `gMCP::generateWeights`. This process is repeated 1000 times. Weighting strategies are matched for all 1000 cases.

```{r generate-weights}
set.seed(1234)
identical <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
  graph <- random_graph(5)
  graphicalmcp_weights <- graphicalMCP::graph_generate_weights(graph)
  dimnames(graphicalmcp_weights) <- list(NULL, NULL)
  gmcp_weights <- 
    gMCP::generateWeights(graph$transitions, graph$hypotheses)
  gmcp_weights <- gmcp_weights[nrow(gmcp_weights):1, ] # Reorder rows
  identical <- c(
    identical, 
    all.equal(gmcp_weights, graphicalmcp_weights, tolerance = 1e-7)
  )
}
all(identical)
```

# Comparisons of sequentially rejective procedures based on Bonferroni tests

## Adjusted p-values for testing
A random graph for five hypotheses will be generated and used for the comparison. A set of p-values is randomly generated to be used for the graphical MCP. Adjusted p-values are calculated and compared using the following functions: `graphical::graph_test_shortcut` and `gMCP::gMCP`. This process is repeated 10000 times. Adjusted p-values are matched for all 10000 cases.

```{r shortcut}
set.seed(1234)
alpha <- 0.025
identical <- NULL
for (i in 1:10000) {
  graph <- random_graph(5)
  p <- runif(5, 0, alpha)
  graphicalmcp_test_shortcut <- 
    graph_test_shortcut(graph, p, alpha = alpha)$outputs$adjusted_p
  gmcp_test_shortcut <- 
    gMCP(as_graphMCP(graph), p, alpha = alpha)@adjPValues
  identical <- c(
    identical, 
    all.equal(graphicalmcp_test_shortcut, gmcp_test_shortcut, tolerance = 1e-7)
  )
}
all(identical)
```

## Power simulations

A random graph for five hypotheses will be generated and used for the comparison. A set of marginal power (without multiplicity adjustment) is randomly generated. Local power (with multiplicity adjustment) is calculated and compared using the following functions: `graphical::graph_calculate_power` and `gMCP::calcPower`. Since different simulation methods are used, results are slightly different. The maximum absolute difference in local power is 0.0051 (0.51%) among 1000 cases, which is relatively small.

```{r power-shortcut, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
alpha <- 0.025
sim_corr <- matrix(.5, 5, 5)
diag(sim_corr) <- 1
graphicalmcp_power <- NULL
gmcp_power <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
  graph <- random_graph(5)
  marginal_power <- runif(5, 0.5, 0.9)
  noncentrality_parameter <-
  qnorm(1 - 0.025, lower.tail = TRUE) -
  qnorm(1 - marginal_power, lower.tail = TRUE)
  
  set.seed(1234 + i - 1)
  graphicalmcp_power <- rbind(
    graphicalmcp_power,
    graph_calculate_power(
      graph,
      alpha = alpha,
      power_marginal = marginal_power,
      sim_corr = sim_corr,
      sim_n = 2^17
    )$power$power_local
  )
  
  set.seed(1234 + i - 1)

    gmcp_power,

      graph$transitions,
      mean = noncentrality_parameter,
      corr.sim = sim_corr,
      n.sim = 2^17
    )$LocalPower
  )
}

  rbind(graphicalmcp_power, gmcp_power),
  procedure = rep(c("graphicalMCP", "gMCP"), each = nrow(graphicalmcp_power))
)

  diff,
  here::here("vignettes/cache/comparisons_power_shortcut.csv"),

  max(
    abs(
      graphicalmcp_power[, - ncol(graphicalmcp_power)] - 
        gmcp_power[, - ncol(gmcp_power)]
      )
    ),

# Comparisons of closed test procedures with parametric tests

## Adjusted p-values for testing
A successive graph with two primary and two secondary hypotheses will be generated and used for the comparison. A set of p-values is randomly generated to be used for the graphical MCP. Adjusted p-values are calculated and compared using the following functions: `graphical::graph_test_closure` and `gMCP::gMCP`. Parametric tests are used for two primary hypotheses. This process is repeated 10000 times. Adjusted p-values are matched for all 10000 cases.

```{r parametric}
hypotheses <- c(.5, .5, 0, 0)
transitions <- rbind(
  c(0, .5, .5, 0),
  c(.5, 0, 0, .5),
  c(0, 1, 0, 0),
  c(1, 0, 0, 0)
)
graph <- graph_create(hypotheses, transitions)

set.seed(1234)
alpha <- 0.025
identical <- NULL
test_corr <- rbind(
  c(1, .5, NA, NA),
  c(.5, 1, NA, NA),
  c(NA, NA, 1, NA),

    graph, 
    p, 
    alpha = alpha,

    test_types = c("parametric", "bonferroni"),
    test_corr = list(test_corr[1:2, 1:2], NA)
  )$outputs$adjusted_p

    as_graphMCP(graph),
    p,
    alpha = 0.025,
    correlation = test_corr

# Comparisons of closed test procedures with Simes tests

## Adjusted p-values for testing
A successive graph with two primary and two secondary hypotheses will be generated and used for the comparison. A set of p-values is randomly generated to be used for the graphical MCP. Adjusted p-values are calculated and compared using the following functions: `graphical::graph_test_closure` and `lrstat::fadjpsim`. Simes tests are used for two primary hypotheses. This process is repeated 10000 times. Adjusted p-values are matched for all 10000 cases.

```{r simes}
hypotheses <- c(.5, .5, 0, 0)
eps <- 0.0001
transitions <- rbind(
  c(0, 1 - eps, eps, 0),
  c(1 - eps, 0, 0, eps),
  c(0, 1, 0, 0),
  c(1, 0, 0, 0)
)
graph <- graph_create(hypotheses, transitions)

set.seed(1234)
alpha <- 0.025
identical <- NULL
family <- rbind(
  c(1, 1, 0, 0),
  c(0, 0, 1, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 1)
)
for (i in 1:10000) {
  p <- runif(4, 0, alpha)
  graphicalmcp_test_simes <- graph_test_closure(
    graph, 
    p, 
    alpha = alpha,
    test_groups = list(1:2, 3:4),
    test_types = c("simes", "bonferroni")
  )$outputs$adjusted_p
  names(graphicalmcp_test_simes) <- NULL
  lrstat_test_simes <-
    fadjpsim(
      fwgtmat(graph$hypotheses, graph$transitions),
      p,
      family
  )
  
  identical <- c(
    identical, 
    all.equal(graphicalmcp_test_simes, lrstat_test_simes, tolerance = 1e-7)
  )
}
all(identical)
```

## Power simulations

Power simulations are not available in `lrstat`. Thus a comparison could be done to compare `graphical::graph_calculate_power` and a manual repetition of `lrstat::fadjpsim` for many sets of marginal power. This process is the same as the above comparison of adjusted p-values, and thus omitted.
