## Introduction

A multiple comparison procedure (MCP) is a statistical analysis method
that allows for assessing the efficacy of multiple endpoints, some of
which are dependent on each other, in a single clinical trial. Endpoints
can be different doses, treatment of different conditions, combined
superiority & non-inferiority testing, or many others.

In [Bretz et al
(2011)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bimj.201000239), a
graphical method for MCPs is described, which separates the weighting of
the dependency graph from the particular statistical test used to assess
each endpoint. This package is a low-dependency implementation of those
methods.

## Installation

graphicalMCP is not on CRAN, so install it from GitHub with

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Gilead-BioStats/graphicalMCP")
```

## Basic usage

### Initial graph

The base object in graphicalMCP is an `initial_graph`, which is a
weighted, directed graph represented by a matrix of transition (edge)
weights, and a vector of hypothesis (vertex) weights.

``` r
library(graphicalMCP)

# A graphical multiple comparison procedure with two primary hypotheses (H1
# and H2) and two secondary hypotheses (H3 and H4)
# See Figure 1 in Bretz, F., Posch, M., Glimm, E., Klinglmueller, F., Maurer,
# W., & Rohmeyer, K. (2011). Graphical approaches for multiple comparison
# procedures using weighted Bonferroni, Simes, or parametric tests. Biometrical
# Journal, 53(6), 894-913.
hypotheses <- c(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0)
transitions <- rbind(
  c(0, 0, 1, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 1),
  c(0, 1, 0, 0),
  c(1, 0, 0, 0)
)

hyp_names <- c("H1", "H2", "H3", "H4")
example_graph <- graph_create(hypotheses, transitions, hyp_names)

example_graph
#> Initial graph
#> 
#> --- Hypothesis weights ---
#> H1: 0.5
#> H2: 0.5
#> H3: 0.0
#> H4: 0.0
#> 
#> --- Transition weights ---
#>     H1 H2 H3 H4
#>  H1  0  0  1  0
#>  H2  0  0  0  1
#>  H3  0  1  0  0
#>  H4  1  0  0  0
```

### Update graph

Hypotheses can be deleted from the MCP using `graph_update()`. Updated
weights and transitions are calculated according to the weighting
strategy in Algorithm 1 of [Bretz et al
(2011)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bimj.201000239). We
distinguish *deleting* from *rejecting* in the [glossary](#glossary).

``` r
graph_update(example_graph, c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))
#> Initial graph
#> 
#> --- Hypothesis weights ---
#> H1: 0.5
#> H2: 0.5
#> H3: 0.0
#> H4: 0.0
#> 
#> --- Transition weights ---
#>     H1 H2 H3 H4
#>  H1  0  0  1  0
#>  H2  0  0  0  1
#>  H3  0  1  0  0
#>  H4  1  0  0  0
#> 
#> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#> 
#> --- Hypotheses kept ---
#>    H1    H2    H3   H4
#>  TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE
#> 
#> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#> 
#> Updated graph
#> 
#> --- Hypothesis weights ---
#> H1: 0.5
#> H2: 0.0
#> H3: 0.0
#> H4: 0.5
#> 
#> --- Transition weights ---
#>     H1 H2 H3 H4
#>  H1  0  0  0  1
#>  H2  0  0  0  0
#>  H3  0  0  0  0
#>  H4  1  0  0  0
```

### Generate weights

The weights of all sub-graphs can be calculated with
`graph_generate_weights()`. This uses more efficient code under the hood
than `graph_update()` in order to be performant for larger graphs.

``` r
graph_generate_weights(example_graph)
#>    H1 H2 H3 H4  H1  H2  H3  H4
#> 1   1  1  1  1 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0
#> 2   1  1  1  0 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0
#> 3   1  1  0  1 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0
#> 4   1  1  0  0 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.0
#> 5   1  0  1  1 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.5
#> 6   1  0  1  0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
#> 7   1  0  0  1 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.5
#> 8   1  0  0  0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
#> 9   0  1  1  1 0.0 0.5 0.5 0.0
#> 10  0  1  1  0 0.0 0.5 0.5 0.0
#> 11  0  1  0  1 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0
#> 12  0  1  0  0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0
#> 13  0  0  1  1 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5
#> 14  0  0  1  0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0
#> 15  0  0  0  1 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
```

### Test hypotheses

A mixture of statistical tests are supported in graphicalMCP. A graph
can be tested against a given significance level with
`graph_test_closure()`, which generates a report showing the graph &
test results. In this example, a weighted Bonferroni test is applied to
all hypotheses, with a significance threshold of 0.025. We can reject
the null hypotheses for H1 & H2, but we cannot reject the null
hypotheses for H3 & H4.

``` r
graph_test_closure(
  example_graph,
  p = c(.01, .02, .03, .05),
  alpha = .025,
  test_types = "bonferroni",
  groups = list(1:4)
)
#> 
#> Test parameters ($inputs) ------------------------------------------------------
#>   Initial graph
#> 
#>   --- Hypothesis weights ---
#>   H1: 0.5
#>   H2: 0.5
#>   H3: 0.0
#>   H4: 0.0
#> 
#>   --- Transition weights ---
#>      H1 H2 H3 H4
#>   H1  0  0  1  0
#>   H2  0  0  0  1
#>   H3  0  1  0  0
#>   H4  1  0  0  0
#> 
#>   Alpha = 0.025
#> 
#>                          H1   H2   H3   H4
#>   Unadjusted p-values: 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.05
#> 
#>   Test types
#>   bonferroni: (H1, H2, H3, H4)
#> 
#> Test summary ($outputs) --------------------------------------------------------
#>   Hypothesis Adj. P-value Reject
#>           H1         0.02   TRUE
#>           H2         0.04  FALSE
#>           H3         0.06  FALSE
#>           H4         0.06  FALSE
#> 
#>   Final updated graph after removing rejected hypotheses
#> 
#>   --- Hypothesis weights ---
#>   H1:  NA
#>   H2: 0.5
#>   H3: 0.5
#>   H4: 0.0
#> 
#>   --- Transition weights ---
#>      H1 H2 H3 H4
#>   H1 NA NA NA NA
#>   H2 NA  0  0  1
#>   H3 NA  1  0  0
#>   H4 NA  0  1  0
```

Other tests, such as parametric- and Simes-based testing, can be used in
addition to, or instead of, Bonferroni. More testing algorithms will be
added over time. Try setting the `verbose` and `test_values` flags for a
more detailed report on testing.

## Power simulations

Itâ€™s not always obvious from a given graph structure how easy or
difficult it will be to reject each hypothesis. One way to understand
this better is to run a power simulation. The essence of a power
simulation is to generate many different p-values using some chosen
distribution, then test the graph against each set of p-values to see
how it performs.

``` r
graph_calculate_power(
  example_graph,
  sim_n = 1e5,
  marginal_power = c(.9, .9, .8, .8)
)
#> 
#> Test parameters ($inputs) ------------------------------------------------------
#>   Initial graph
#> 
#>   --- Hypothesis weights ---
#>   H1: 0.5
#>   H2: 0.5
#>   H3: 0.0
#>   H4: 0.0
#> 
#>   --- Transition weights ---
#>      H1 H2 H3 H4
#>   H1  0  0  1  0
#>   H2  0  0  0  1
#>   H3  0  1  0  0
#>   H4  1  0  0  0
#> 
#>   Alpha = 0.025
#> 
#>   Test types
#>   bonferroni: (H1, H2, H3, H4)
#> 
#> Simulation parameters ($inputs) ------------------------------------------------
#>   Testing 100,000 simulations with multivariate normal params:
#> 
#>                    H1  H2  H3  H4
#>   Marginal power: 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.8
#> 
#>   Correlation:    H1 H2 H3 H4
#>                H1  1  0  0  0
#>                H2  0  1  0  0
#>                H3  0  0  1  0
#>                H4  0  0  0  1
#> 
#> Power calculation ($power) -----------------------------------------------------
#>                                    H1      H2      H3      H4
#>                  Local power: 0.87755 0.87554 0.67220 0.67089
#> 
#>   Expected no. of rejections: 3.09618
#>    Power to reject 1 or more: 0.97437
#>          Power to reject all: 0.50385
```

All valid test types are also valid for power simulations.

## Related work

These methods were originally implemented in R after the 2011 paper in
the [gMCP package](https://github.com/kornl/gMCP), which is still
available on CRAN today. There is also a lighter version of gMCP
implemented in [gMCPmini](https://github.com/allenzhuaz/gMCPmini) and
its successor, [gMCPLite](https://github.com/Merck/gMCPLite). These two
contain only a subset of the original functionality, but they remove the
rJava dependency and add plotting functionality based on ggplot2.

However, because development has ceased on the original package, we hope
to re-implement the methods with a clearer distinction between weighting
procedures and test procedures; with fewer dependencies, in particular
shedding the Java dependency; with the simpler, more transparent S3
class framework; and with improvements to the accuracy of the parametric
and Simes test methods.

A portion of Simes testing is also implemented in the lrstat package
(`install.packages("lrstat")`).

## Glossary of terms

This package seeks to be both accurate and performant, of course. But
beyond that, much thought has been put into the readability of the code.
Whether being read by a user validating our methods, a developer
extending the package to new uses, or a contributor helping enhance the
package, we hope that the code contained here can serve as an
educational document to grow peopleâ€™s understanding of the graphical
approach to multiple comparison procedures.

To that end, there are several entities encountered in the world of
graphical MCPs that we define here. Some of these are used only in the
internal code of the package, but most are output from one or more
exported functions. If you believe any definitions could be clarified or
improved, please contact the package authors or submit an issue to the
GitHub repository.
