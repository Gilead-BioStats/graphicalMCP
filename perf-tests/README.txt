# Contact Dong Xi at dong.xi@novartis.com for questions related to the code

# This submission contains
# 1 folder functions of 3 files: fun_miscellaneous.R, fun_common_c.R and fun_separate_c.R
## They are functions to generate results and simulations in the paper
# 4 files: Table_1_weighting_scheme.R, Table_2_adjusted_p_value.R, Table_3_simulation.R and Table_4_5_local_significance_level.R
## They are for the results in Table 1 to Table 5.

# To reproduce the results in the paper, go to each file for a particular table
# First load the functions in the folder functions
# Then follow the instruction in the file
