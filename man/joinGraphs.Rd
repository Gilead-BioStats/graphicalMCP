\title{Joins two graphMCP objects}
\usage{
joinGraphs(graph1, graph2, xOffset = 0, yOffset = 200)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph1}{A graph of class \code{\link{graphMCP}}.}

\item{graph2}{A graph of class \code{\link{graphMCP}}.}

\item{xOffset}{A numeric specifying an offset (on the x-axis) for placing
the nodes and edge labels of the second graph.}

\item{yOffset}{A numeric specifying an offset (on the y-axis) for placing
the nodes and edge labels of the second graph.}
}
\value{
A graphMCP object that represents a graph that consists of the two
given graphs.
}
\description{
Creates a new graphMCP object by joining two given graphMCP objects.
}
\details{
If \code{graph1} and \code{graph2} have duplicates in the node names, the
nodes of the second graph will be renamed.

If and only if the sum of the weights of graph1 and graph2 exceeds 1, the
weights are scaled so that the sum equals 1.

A description attribute of either graph will be discarded.
