\usage{
gMCP(graph, pvalues, test, correlation, alpha = 0.05, approxEps = TRUE,
  eps = 10^(-3), ..., upscale = ifelse(missing(test) &&
  !missing(correlation) || !missing(test) && test == "Bretz2011", TRUE, FALSE),
  useC = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, keepWeights = FALSE, adjPValues = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A graph of class \code{\link{graphMCP}}.}

\item{pvalues}{A numeric vector specifying the p-values for the graph based
MCP. Note the assumptions in the details section for the parametric tests, 
when a correlation is specified.}

\item{test}{Should be either \code{"Bonferroni"}, \code{"Simes"} or \code{"parametric"}.
If not specified by default the Bonferroni-based test procedure is used if no
correlation is specified or the algorithm from Bretz et al. 2011 if a
correlation is specified. If \code{test} is set to \code{"Simes"} the weighted
Simes test will be performed for each subset of hypotheses.}

\item{correlation}{Optional correlation matrix.  If the weighted Simes test
is performed, it is checked whether type I error rate can be ensured and a
warning is given if this is not the case.  For parametric tests the p-values
must arise from one-sided tests with multivariate normal distributed test
statistics for which the correlation is (partially) known. In that case a
weighted parametric closed test is performed (also see
\code{\link{generatePvals}}). Unknown values can be set to NA. (See details
for more information)}

\item{alpha}{A numeric specifying the maximal allowed type one error rate.}

\item{approxEps}{A boolean specifying whether epsilon values should be
substituted with the value given in the parameter \code{eps}.}

\item{eps}{A numeric scalar specifying a value for epsilon edges.}

\item{...}{Test specific arguments can be given here.}

\item{upscale}{Logical. If \code{upscale=FALSE} then for each intersection 
of hypotheses (i.e. each subgraph) a weighted test is performed at the 
possibly reduced level alpha of sum(w)*alpha, 
where sum(w) is the sum of all node weights in this subset.
If \code{upscale=TRUE} all weights are upscaled, so that sum(w)=1.

For backward comptibility the default value is TRUE if a the parameter \code{test}
is missing, but parameter \code{correlation} is specified or if \code{test=="Bretz2011"}.}

\item{useC}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE} neither adjusted p-values nor
intermediate graphs are returned, but the calculation is sped up by using
code written in C. THIS CODE IS NOT FOR PRODUCTIVE USE YET!  If approxEps is
\code{FALSE} and the graph contains epsilon edges, a warning is thrown and
\code{useC} will be ignored.}

\item{verbose}{Logical scalar. If \code{TRUE} verbose output is generated.}

\item{keepWeights}{Logical scalar. If \code{FALSE} the weight of a node
without outgoing edges is set to 0 if it is removed.  Otherwise it keeps its
weight.}

\item{adjPValues}{Logical scalar. If \code{FALSE} no adjusted p-values will
be calculated.  Especially for the weighted Simes test this will result in
significantly less calculations in most cases.}

\details{
For the Bonferroni procedure the p-values can arise from any statistical
test, but if you improve the test by specifying a correlation matrix, the
following assumptions apply:

It is assumed that under the global null hypothesis
\eqn{(\Phi^{-1}(1-p_1),...,\Phi^{-1}(1-p_m))} follow a multivariate normal
distribution with correlation matrix \code{correlation} where
\eqn{\Phi^{-1}} denotes the inverse of the standard normal distribution
function.

For example, this is the case if \eqn{p_1,..., p_m} are the raw p-values
from one-sided z-tests for each of the elementary hypotheses where the
correlation between z-test statistics is generated by an overlap in the
observations (e.g. comparison with a common control, group-sequential
analyses etc.). An application of the transformation \eqn{\Phi^{-1}(1-p_i)}
to raw p-values from a two-sided test will not in general lead to a
multivariate normal distribution. Partial knowledge of the correlation
matrix is supported. The correlation matrix has to be passed as a numeric
matrix with elements of the form: \eqn{correlation[i,i] = 1} for diagonal
elements, \eqn{correlation[i,j] = \rho_{ij}}, where \eqn{\rho_{ij}} is the
known value of the correlation between \eqn{\Phi^{-1}(1-p_i)} and
\eqn{\Phi^{-1}(1-p_j)} or \code{NA} if the corresponding correlation is
unknown. For example correlation[1,2]=0 indicates that the first and second
test statistic are uncorrelated, whereas correlation[2,3] = NA means that
the true correlation between statistics two and three is unknown and may
take values between -1 and 1. The correlation has to be specified for
complete blocks (ie.: if cor(i,j), and cor(i,j') for i!=j!=j' are specified
then cor(j,j') has to be specified as well) otherwise the corresponding
intersection null hypotheses tests are not uniquely defined and an error is
returned.
