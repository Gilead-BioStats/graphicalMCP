\title{graphicalMCP: Graphical Multiple Comparison Procedures}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Multiple comparison procedures (MCPs) control the familywise error rate in clinical trials. Graphical MCPs include many commonly used procedures as special cases; see Bretz et al. (2011) \doi{10.1002/bimj.201000239}, Lu (2016) \doi{10.1002/sim.6985}, and Xi et al. (2017) \doi{10.1002/bimj.201600233}. This package is a low-dependency implementation of graphical MCPs which allow mixed types of tests. It also includes power simulations and visualization of graphical MCPs.
