\title{EXPERIMENTAL: Construct a valid level alpha test for the second stage of an
adaptive design that is based on a pre-planned graphical MCP}
\usage{
secondStageTest(interim, select, matchCE = TRUE, zWeights = "reject",
  G2 = interim@preplanned)
}
\arguments{
\item{interim}{An object of class \code{\link{gPADInterim}}.}

\item{select}{A logical vector giving specifying which hypotheses are
carried forward to the second stage}

\item{matchCE}{Logical specifying whether second stage weights should be
computed proportional to corresponding PCEs}

\item{zWeights}{Either "reject","accept", or "strict" giving the rule what
should be done in cases where none of the selected hypotheses has positive
second stage weight.}

\item{G2}{An object of class \code{\link{graphMCP}} laying down the rule to
compute second stage weights. Defaults to pre-planned graph.}
}
\value{
A function of signature \code{function(z2)} with arguments
\code{z2} a numeric vector with second stage z-scores (Z-scores of
dropped hypotheses should be set no \code{NA})
that returns objects of class \code{\link{gMCPResult}}.
}
\description{
Based on a pre-planned graphical multiple comparison procedure, construct a
valid multiple level alpha test that conserves the family wise error in the
strong sense regardless of any trial adaptations during an unblinded interim
analysis. - Implementation of adaptive procedures is still in an early stage
and may change in the near future

\examples{


## Simple successive graph (Maurer et al. 2011)
## two treatments two hierarchically ordered endpoints
a <- .025
G <- simpleSuccessiveI()
## some z-scores:

p1=c(.1,.12,.21,.16)
z1 <- qnorm(1-p1)
p2=c(.04,1,.14,1)
z2 <- qnorm(1-p2)
v <- c(1/2,1/3,1/2,1/3)

intA <- doInterim(G,z1,v)

## select only the first treatment 
fTest <- secondStageTest(intA,c(1,0,1,0))
