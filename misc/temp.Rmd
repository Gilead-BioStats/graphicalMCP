## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot-1, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4, 4)}
plot(simple_successive_2(), layout = "grid")
```

```{r plot-2, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4, 4)}
plot(graph_update(simple_successive_2(), c(T, F, T, T)), layout = "grid", precision = 4)
```

```{r plot-3, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4, 4)}
plot(graph_update(simple_successive_2(), c(T, F, T, F)), layout = "grid")
```

```{r plot-4, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4, 4)}
plot(graph_update(simple_successive_2(), c(F, F, T, F)), layout = "grid")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
