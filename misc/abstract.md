# Introducing graphicalMCP: A package & primer for the graphical approach to multiple comparison procedures using R

Multiple comparison procedures provide a method to compare several groups with a control in a single experiment, while controlling the family-wise error rate. The graphical approach to MCPs divides them into separate weighting and testing strategies, where the weighting is (mostly) agnostic to the test chosen. This system allows classic approaches like Bonferroni to be used, while also being flexible enough to enable full customization for how the significance level can be divided among hypotheses. This customization may improve power, and an accompanying visualization of the graph aids in communication about the study design. The graphicalMCP R package is a lightweight, R-native implementation of this graphical approach, built to easily generalize to many classes of tests while still being efficient. Furthermore, the code itself is written descriptively to serve as a knowledge source for the core methods in this field. Written as a partnership between Gilead and Atorus Research.
